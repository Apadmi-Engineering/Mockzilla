The iOS implementation of the `mockzilla` package.

## Usage

This platform-specific implementation of `mockzilla` is endorsed. This means that when targeting iOS in your Flutter application, this package is automatically used and you do not need to 
manually add it to your `pubspec.yaml`.

That said, if you do use any APIs defined in this package directly, it is good practice to add this 
package as a dependency.
