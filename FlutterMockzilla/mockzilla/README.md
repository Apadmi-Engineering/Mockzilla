A plugin for configuring and running a local HTTP server that mimics a REST API consumed by your Flutter mobile app.

> This plugin is currently under development, the API is unstable and it's implementation may contain bugs.

## Features

* Compile safe mock endpoint definitions.
* HTTP Client agnostic.
* Works completely offline.
* Entirely self-contained within your application's codebase.

## Getting started

TODO: Update online documentation with Flutter usage instructions and include a link here.

## Important note

Mockzilla is designed as a development and test tool **only**.

Mockzilla should **never be used in production**. Its traffic is unprotected and by nature of running a server on device, it can introduce security issues.

**Do not ship it to production**.
