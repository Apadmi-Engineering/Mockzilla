# Flutter Mockzilla

This is the root directory for all the Flutter packages in Mockzilla.

The Flutter package is implemented as a [federated plugin package](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/developing-packages#federated-plugins) 
which separates the interfaces from each platform implementation. To manage these packages, the repository uses [melos](https://melos.invertase.dev/).
