# Mockzilla Android Example

This Android example app exists such that the `mockzilla_android` Flutter plugin can be built, 
thereby allowing native unit tests to be run on CI.

If you are looking for an example on how to use the Mockzilla plugin, please see the main plugin 
example [here](https://github.com/Apadmi-Engineering/Mockzilla/tree/develop/FlutterMockzilla/mockzilla/example).
